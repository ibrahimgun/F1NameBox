F1NameBox, a simple vue project I made using the two-way binding method. Position, first name, surname, number, short name and constructor name are requested from the user. It was created using F1TV graphics and font in styling. While creating the code structure, I made use of the [**@bodzaital/f1-grapchis** ](https://github.com/bodzaital/f1-graphics-css)css part.

Using the [**Ergast API,**](http://ergast.com/mrd/) I pulled the standings data of the drivers with fetch.
